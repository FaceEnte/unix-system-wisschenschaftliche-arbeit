# 🧠 Thesis: Unix as the Foundation of Modern Operating Systems

This repository contains my short thesis on **Unix** and its foundational role in the development of modern operating systems.
The paper explores the historical significance of Unix, its design philosophy, and how its principles are reflected in contemporary systems like 
**Linux**, **macOS**, and to some extent **Windows**.


## 📄 Abstract

Unix, developed in the late 1970s, introduced revolutionary ideas in system design, including portability, simplicity, and modularity. 
This thesis investigates how these core concepts influenced the architecture and functionality of today’s most widely used operating systems. 
A comparative analysis shows the legacy of Unix in modern platforms and discusses its relevance in current computing environments.


## 📚 Key Topics

- History and evolution of Unix
- Unix design principles: modularity, process model, and file system
- Influence on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- POSIX standards


## 🔍 Goal

The goal of this thesis is to highlight Unix not only as an operating system but as a **design philosophy** that continues to shape computing. 
It aims to provide a concise yet insightful overview suitable for students, educators, and tech enthusiasts.
